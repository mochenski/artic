# Dashboard using Laravel and Vue.js

This is a personal project created to study the basics of a Dashboard. I will try to make the code simple and easy to understand.

The idea is to achieve **at least** the following items.

 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Project Setup using Laravel as back-end and Nuxt as front-end 
 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Auth using Laravel passport
 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Login and Register using Nuxt
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/0/) Articles controller "CRUD" Laravel
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/0/) Blog functionality (Laravel relationships)
