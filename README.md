## Technologies
Artic was created in order to understand the relation between a Rest API and a frontend webpage. To acheive this, I used two different frameworks **Laravel** and **Nuxt.js**.

[**Laravel**](https://laravel.com/ "Laravel - The PHP Framework") - The PHP framework used to create Artic's Rest API.

[**Nuxt.js**](https://nuxtjs.org/ "The intuitive Vue Framework") - The Vue framework used to create Artic's webpage.

# Dashboard using Laravel and Vue.js

This is a personal project created to study the basics of a Dashboard. I will try to make the code simple and easy to understand.

The idea is to achieve **at least** the following items.

 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Project Setup using Laravel as back-end and Nuxt as front-end 
 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Auth using Laravel passport
 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Login and Register using Nuxt
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/75/) Articles backend "CRUD" Laravel // *Update*
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/60/) Articles frontend (index, articles, article, dashboard[update, delete])
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/45/) Blog functionality (Nuxt blog) and (Laravel relationships)
