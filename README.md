# Dashboard using Laravel and Vue.js

This is a personal project created to study the basics of a Dashboard. I will try to make the code simple and easy to understand.

The idea is to achieve **at least** the following items.

 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Project Setup using Laravel as back-end and Nuxt as front-end 
 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Auth using Laravel passport
 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Login and Register using Nuxt
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/90/) Articles backend "CRUD" Laravel // *Update*
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/15/) Articles frontend (index, articles, article, dashboard[update, delete])
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/45/) Blog functionality (Nuxt blog) and (Laravel relationships)
