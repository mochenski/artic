# Dashboard using Laravel and Vue.js

This is a personal project created to study the basics of a Dashboard. I will try to make the code simple and easy to understand.

The idea is to achieve **at least** the following items.

    - Login form
    - General CRUD using laravel
    - General layout using Vue.js
