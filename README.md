# Dashboard using Laravel and Vue.js

This is a personal project created to study the basics of a Dashboard. I will try to make the code simple and easy to understand.

The idea is to achieve **at least** the following items.

 - [x] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Project using Laravel as back-end and Vue as front-end 
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/10/) Index of a personal page using Vue.js
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/0/) Blog Structure using Laravel and Vue.js
 - [ ] ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/0/) Dashboard to controll Blog (Login, post CRUD)
